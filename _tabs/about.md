> I'm an Azure Engineer documenting my journey as I go. I share content on all things Azure â€” whether it's Azure DevOps or broader cloud topics. I'm a huge Bicep advocate and love anything automation. Blogs played a big role in my own growth, so I hope to pass on that value and help you discover something new. Most likely you will see me write up ideas that I haven't seen many others write up.
